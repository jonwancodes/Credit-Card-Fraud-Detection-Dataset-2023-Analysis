# Credit Card Fraud Detection 2023 Dataset Analysis & Machine Learning
### Author: Jonathan Wan 

This project uses the `Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset 2023` which contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. It comprises **over 550,000 records**, and the data has been anonymized to protect the cardholders' identities. The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the development of fraud detection algorithms and models to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.

Key Features:
- `id` : Unique identifier for each transaction
- `V1-V28` : Anonymized features representing various transaction attributes (e.g., time, location, etc.)
- `Amount` : The transaction amount
- `Class` : Binary label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)

*Data Source: The dataset was collected from credit card transactions made by European cardholders in 2023, with sensitive information removed to ensure privacy and compliance with ethical guidelines.*
